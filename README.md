# KucingKU-Bangkit-Machine-Learning-Team
# This contains what Machine Learning's team do
## Project Status
This project is a sub-repository for the Machine Learning team and is currently in the intergrating to app stage

## Description
**KucingKu Machine Learning** is a part of the main "KucingKu" project, 

### Development Process

#### 1. Data Gathering
- [x] Identify data sources for model training.
- [x] Collect datasets covering various cat breeds.

#### 2. Data Preparation
- [x] Clean data from missing or invalid values.
- [x] Merge different datasets into one main dataset.

#### 3. Data Wrangling
- [x] Preprocess data to prepare features for the model.
- [x] Adjust the data format to fit the needs of the machine learning algorithm.

#### 4. Analyze Data
- [x] Analyze the distribution of features in the dataset.
- [x] Determine features that significantly impact the model's outcomes.

#### 5. Train Model
- [x] Select a suitable machine learning model for the project's goals.
- [x] Train the model using the prepared dataset.

#### 6. Test Model
- [x] Test the model using a separate test dataset.
- [x] Evaluate the model's performance and perform fine-tuning.
